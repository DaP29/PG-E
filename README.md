Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) : Exploratory Data Analysis of Energy consumption (2013-2021)

This is a project to analyze PG&E customers energy consumption. Data was collected from PG&E website : https://pge-energydatarequest.com/public_datasets

In this project I not only explore the consumption data of different types of customers ( Residential, Industrial, Agricultural, and Commercial) but also **test different hypotheses**:

- **Seasonality hypothesis - ttest & permutation test**
- **Consumption volume hypothesis - ANOVA test**
